# Rubik's Cube Solver

This project is a Rubik's Cube solver implemented in C++. It utilizes a Makefile for easy compilation and execution of the program.

## Intended Features

- A Rubik's Cube in OpenGL with keyboard controls to mix and solve.
- Efficient solving algorithm.
- Genetic Algorithm for ML to solve Rubik's cube using internal game engine calculations.

## Prerequisites

- g++ compiler (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp)
